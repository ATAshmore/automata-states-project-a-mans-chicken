# automata-states-project-a-mans-chicken
Automata project demonstrating understanding of the automata theory course through an animation developed on Unity

This is a visual project and a short animation can be watched at this youtube link: [A Man's Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QI5Oa0jaaOk).
The project is too large to upload to GitHub, if you would like to run the 'game' you can download the files through Google Drive: [Game Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gVIxDqrzl_eFFlvJOgm55QHeEi6Ot5cT/view?usp=sharing)
